# Autonomous-Car-App

In partnership with the FIAP University Center and Braskem, we developed an autonomous car project to transport employees between Braskem's industrial plants. In this repository you will find the mobile application developed in Ionic for the user to use the technology.

This project was developed at FIAP in 2018, SÃ£o Paulo - SP.
